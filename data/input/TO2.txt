Heilbronn, October 7th, 2021 – With two new headphones and microphones, beyerdynamic is introducing a new era for creators.
The two headphones DT 700 PRO X and DT 900 PRO X promise an unprecedented performance in the class of studio headphones on all playback devices.
The M 70 PRO X dynamic microphone and the M 90 PRO X true condenser microphone deliver detailed sound.
Whether live streaming or recording, at home or in the studio, the PRO X series can be used flexibly in all situations.
The new product series is characterized by authentic sound and a functional, timeless design.
<p>
DT 700 PRO X AND DT 900 PRO X – TOP CLASS HEADPHONES
<p>
The new PRO X headphones embody what beyerdynamic is world-famous for:
Trusted sound quality paired with maximum comfort.
The closed-back DT 700 PRO X can be used for production in the home studio as well as on-the-go on a laptop, tablet, or smartphone.
The counterpart to this is the open-back DT 900 PRO X, with a pair of circumaural studio headphones that highlights its strengths in professional monitoring, mixing and mastering.
<p>
The new STELLAR.45 driver was developed from beyerdynamic in Heilbronn and ensures a loud and powerful sound on all playback devices.
A strong neodymium magnet and a voice coil made of copper-plated high-tech wire make this possible.
The conductivity and weight of the wire are perfectly balanced.
In combination with the newly developed three-layer speaker cone with integrated attenuating layer, the new PRO X headphones have a highly efficient driver system that has an impedance of 48 ohms.
The transducer's fast response and detailed transient reproduction due to the lightweight voice coil ensures reliable sound without distortion, even at high sound pressure levels.
<p>
The new headphones impress with their functional design.
Both models come with two mini-XLR cables, which can be changed in no time and replaced with other connection options.
Smooth gray velour ear pads and soft memory foam in the headband guarantee the familiar high level of comfort – there is no feeling of pressure or discomfort, even after several hours of wearing.
The combination of robust spring steel bracket construction and high-quality materials ensures a long service life for the handmade headphones from Heilbronn.
If necessary, almost all parts can be replaced, making the DT 700 PRO X and DT 900 PRO X a faithful companion for every creator.
<p>
M 70 PRO X AND M 90 PRO X – A MUST-HAVE FOR CREATORS
<p>
In the studio, at home or for project recordings:
The two microphones – M 70 PRO X and M 90 PRO X – can be used flexibly and are designed to meet the needs of Creators.
The M 70 PRO X for broadcasting, podcasting and streaming, and the M 90 PRO X for recording vocals and instruments.
The microphones from the new PRO X series are characterized by a natural sound recording.
They deliver the most detailed nuances and an exceedingly low-noise signal at all volumes.
Elastic system suspension as well as the stable microphone spider audibly reduce unwanted sounds like footsteps, hand grips or keyboard noise.
A pop filter ensures that breathing noises and harsh plosive sounds are softened.
<p>
The M 70 PRO X is the microphone for all broadcasters who want the perfect sound at home and on the road – ideal for streamers, podcasters or YouTubers.
The sound of this model has been optimized specifically for speech, and the microphone almost completely blocks out surrounding noise to deliver the best sound – even in acoustically challenging environments.
<p>
With the M 90 PRO X, beyerdynamic offers an XLR microphone for recordings at home and in the studio.
With its detailed sound and perfectly balanced signal-to-noise ratio, it is ideal for vocals, instruments, and voice recordings, such as voice-overs.
<p>
THE LEGENDARY AUTHENTIC SOUND OF BEYERDYNAMIC
<p>
Both microphones deliver clear and natural sound recordings.
Thanks to tuned proximity effect, the microphones never sound dull, and the extended upper frequency range picks up every detail of the voice.
Mids are reproduced with the usual power and bass is extremely natural.
A low-noise operational amplifier and a precise voltage regulator create a clear, warm sound.
<p>
The new product series features a minimalist black design consisting of premium and interchangeable parts such as capsule, circuit board or connector.
The high-quality aluminum housing and the robust steel mesh protect the microphone and reduce the weight of the M 70 PRO X, so that it can be attached to any tripod or microphone arm.
<p>
THE PRO X SERIES IN THE CREATOR TEST
<p>
Creators are at the center of the new campaign.
In collaboration with selected artists, beyerdynamic demonstrates the capabilities of the new PRO X series.
The singer Rola, the producers Dexter and iamnobodi as well as the mixing & mastering engineer Volker “IDR” Gebhardt have created a song with the equipment of the new PRO X series that can be watched and heard.
The creation process of the song was accompanied by podcaster Miriam Davoudvandi.
